## Select a Retool version number
We recommend you set your Retool deployment to a specific version of Retool (that is, a specific semver version number in the format `X.Y.Z`, instead of a tag name). This will help prevent unexpected behavior in your Retool instances. When you are ready to upgrade Retool, you can bump the version number to the specific new version you want.

To help you select a version, see our guide on [Retool Release Versions](https://docs.retool.com/docs/updating-retool-on-premise#retool-release-versions).
    * If you're not sure which version to install, we recommend starting with the "release-candidate". To find out the specific version number of the "release-candidate", visit [Retool Release Versions](https://docs.retool.com/docs/updating-retool-on-premise#retool-release-versions). (As of early April 2021 the "release-candidate" version is "2.65.3".)

## Simple Deployments

Get set up in 15 minutes by deploying Retool on a single machine. 

### Deploying on EC2
Spin up a new EC2 instance. If using AWS, use the following steps:
1. Click **Launch Instance** from the EC2 dashboard.
1. Click **Select** for an instance of Ubuntu `16.04` or higher.
1. Select an instance type of at least `t3.medium` and click **Next**.
1. Ensure you select the VPC that also includes the databases / API’s you will want to connect to and click **Next**.
1. Increase the storage size to `60` GB or higher and click **Next**. 
1. Optionally add some Tags (e.g. `app = retool`) and click **Next**. This makes it easier to find if you have a lot of instances.
1. Set the network security groups for ports `80`, `443`, `22` and `3000`, with sources set to `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0`, and click **Review and Launch**. We need to open ports `80` (http) and `443` (https) so you can connect to the server from a browser, as well as port `22` (ssh) so that you can ssh into the instance to configure it and run Retool. By default on a vanilla EC2, Retool will run on port `3000`. 
1. On the **Review Instance Launch** screen, click **Launch** to start your instance.
1. If you're connecting to internal databases, whitelist the VPS's IP address in your database.
1. From your command line tool, SSH into your EC2 instance.
1. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/tryretool/retool-onpremise.git`.
1. Run the command `cd retool-onpremise` to enter the cloned repository's directory.
1. Edit the `Dockerfile` to set the version of Retool you want to install. To do this, replace `X.Y.Z` in `FROM tryretool/backend:X.Y.Z` with your desired version. See [Select a Retool version number](#select-a-retool-version-number) to help you choose a version.
1. Run `./install.sh` to install Docker and Docker Compose.
1. In your `docker.env` (this file is only created after running `./install.sh`) add the following:
    ```
    # License key granted to you by Retool
    LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY 

    # This is necessary if you plan on logging in before setting up https
    COOKIE_INSECURE=true 
    ```
1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the Retool server.
1. Run `sudo docker-compose ps` to make sure all the containers are up and running.
1. Navigate to your server's IP address in a web browser. Retool should now be running on port `3000`.
1. Click Sign Up, since we're starting from a clean slate. The first user to into an instance becomes the administrator. 

### Deploying on Heroku

Just use the Deploy to Heroku button below! You'll then have to go to Settings and set the `LICENSE_KEY` config var.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)
### Manually setting up Retool on Heroku

Alternatively, you may follow the following steps to deploy to Heroku

1. Install the Heroku CLI, and login. Documentation for this can be found here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/tryretool/retool-onpremise`
1. Change the working directory to the newly cloned repository `cd ./retool-onpremise`
1. Create a new Heroku app with the stack set to `container` with `heroku create your-app-name --stack=container`
1. Add a free database: `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`
1. In the `Settings` page of your Heroku app, add the following environment variables:
    1. `NODE_ENV` - set to `production`
    1. `HEROKU_HOSTED` set to `true`
    1. `JWT_SECRET`  - set to a long secure random string used to sign JSON Web Tokens
    1. `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - a long secure random string used to encrypt database credentials
    2. `LICENSE_KEY` - your Retool license key
1. Push the code: `git push heroku master`

To lockdown the version of Retool used, just edit the first line under `./heroku/Dockerfile` to:
```
FROM tryretool/backend:X.Y.Z
```

### Running Retool using Aptible

1. Add your public SSH key to your Aptible account through the Aptible dashboard
1. Install the Aptible CLI, and login. Documentation for this can be found here: https://www.aptible.com/documentation/deploy/cli.html
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/tryretool/retool-onpremise`
1. Change the working directory to the newly cloned repository `cd ./retool-onpremise`
1. Edit the `Dockerfile` to set the version of Retool you want to install. To do this, replace `X.Y.Z` in `FROM tryretool/backend:X.Y.Z` with your desired version. See [Select a Retool version number](#select-a-retool-version-number) to help you choose a version.
1. Create a new Aptible app with `aptible apps:create your-app-name`
1. Add a database: `aptible db:create your-database-name --type postgresql`
1. Set your config variables (your database connection string will be in your Aptible Dashboard and you can parse out the individual values by following [these instructions](https://www.aptible.com/documentation/deploy/reference/databases/credentials.html#using-database-credentials)). Be sure to rename `EXPIRED-LICENSE-KEY-TRIAL` to the license key provided to you. 
    ```
    aptible config:set --app your-app-name \
        POSTGRES_DB=your-db \
        POSTGRES_HOST=your-db-host \
        POSTGRES_USER=your-user \
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-db-password \
        POSTGRES_PORT=your-db-port \
        POSTGRES_SSL_ENABLED=true \
        FORCE_SSL=true \
        NODE_ENV=production \
        JWT_SECRET=$(cat /dev/urandom | base64 | head -c 256) \
        ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(cat /dev/urandom | base64 | head -c 64) \
        LICENSE_KEY=EXPIRED-LICENSE-KEY-TRIAL
    ```
1. Set your git remote which you can find in the Aptible dashboard: `git remote add aptible your-git-url`
1. Push the code: `git push aptible master`
1. Create a default Aptible endpoint
1. Navigate to your endpoint and sign up as a new user in your Retool instance

### Deploying to Render

Just use the Deploy to Render button below! Here are [some docs](https://render.com/docs/deploy-retool) on deploying Retool with Render.

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/render-examples/retool)

## Managed deployments

Deploy Retool on a managed service. We've provided some starter template files for Cloudformation setups (ECS + Fargate), Kubernetes, and Helm. 

### Deploying on ECS

We provide a [template file](/cloudformation/retool.yaml) for you to get started deploying on ECS. 

1. In the ECS Dashboard, click **Create Cluster**
1. Select `EC2 Linux + Networking` as the cluster template.
1. In your instance configuration, enter the following:
    - Select **On-demand instance**
    - Select **t2.medium** as the instance type
    - (Optional) Choose how many instances you want to spin up
    - (Optional) Add key pair 
    - Choose your existing VPC (or create a new one)
    - (Optional) Add tags
    - Enable CloudWatch container insights
1. Select the VPC in which you’d like to launch the ECS cluster; make sure that you select a [public subnet](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48830793/aws-vpc-identify-private-and-public-subnet).
1. Download the [retool.yaml](/cloudformation/retool.yaml) file, and add your license key and other relevant variables.
1. Go to the AWS Cloudformation dashboard, and click **Create Stack with new resources → Upload a template file**. Upload your edited `retool.yaml` file.
1. Then, enter the following parameters:
    - Cluster: the name of the ECS cluster you created earlier
    - DesiredCount: 2
    - Environment: staging
    - Force: false
    - Image: `tryretool/backend:X.Y.Z` (But replace `X.Y.Z` with your desired version. See [Select a Retool version number](#select-a-retool-version-number) to help you choose a version.)
    - MaximumPercent: 250
    - MinimumPercent: 50
    - SubnetId: Select 2 subnets in your VPC - make sure these subnets are public (have an internet gateway in their route table)
    - VPC ID: select the VPC you want to use 
1. Click through to create the stack; this could take up to 15 minutes; you can monitor the progress of the stack being created in the `Events` tab in Cloudformation
1. After everything is complete, you should see all the resources with a `CREATE_COMPLETE` status.
1. In the **Outputs** section within the CloudFormation dashboard, you should be able to find the ALB DNS URL. This is where Retool should be running.

### Deploying on ECS with Fargate

We provide Fargate template files supporting [public](/cloudformation/fargate.yaml) and [private](/cloudformation/fargate.private.yaml) subnets. 

1. In the ECS Dashboard, click **Create Cluster**
1. In **Step 1: Select a cluster template**, select `Networking Only (Powered by AWS Fargate)` as the cluster template.
1. In **Step 2: Configure cluster**, be sure to enable CloudWatch Container Insights. This will help us monitor logs and the health of our deployment through CloudWatch.
1. Download the [public](/cloudformation/fargate.yaml) or [private](/cloudformation/fargate.private.yaml) template file, and add your license key and other relevant variables.
1. Go to the AWS Cloudformation dashboard, and click **Create Stack with new resources → Upload a template file**. Upload your edited `.yaml` file.
1. Enter the following parameters:
    - Cluster: the name of the ECS cluster you created earlier
    - DesiredCount: 2
    - Environment: staging
    - Force: false
    - Image: `tryretool/backend:X.Y.Z` (But replace `X.Y.Z` with your desired version. See [Select a Retool version number](#select-a-retool-version-number) to help you choose a version.)
    - MaximumPercent: 250
    - MinimumPercent: 50
    - SubnetId: Select 2 subnets in your VPC - make sure these subnets are public (have an internet gateway in their route table)
    - VPC ID: select the VPC you want to use  
1. Click through to create the stack; this could take up to 15 minutes; you can monitor the progress of the stack being created in the `Events` tab in Cloudformation
1. In the **Outputs** section, you should be able to find the ALB DNS URL.
1. Currently the load balancer is listening on port 3000; to make it available on port 80 we have to go to the **EC2 dashboard → Load Balancers → Listeners** and click Edit to to change the port to 80.
    - If you get an error that your security group does not allow traffic on this listener port, you must add an inbound rule allowing HTTP on port 80.
1. In the **Outputs** section within the CloudFormation dashboard, you should be able to find the ALB DNS URL. This is where Retool should be running.

### Deploying on Kubernetes

1. Navigate into the `kubernetes` directory
1. Edit the `retool-container.yaml` file to set the version of Retool you want to install. To do this, replace `X.Y.Z` in `image: tryretool/backend:X.Y.Z` with your desired version. See [Select a Retool version number](#select-a-retool-version-number) to help you choose a version.
2. Copy the `retool-secrets.template.yaml` file to `retool-secrets.yaml` and inside the `{{ ... }}` sections, replace with a suitable base64 encoded string. 
    1. To base64 encode your license key, run `echo -n <license key> | base64` in the command line. Be sure to add the `-n` character, as it removes the trailing newline character from the encoding.
    1. If you do not wish to add google authentication, replace the templates with an empty string.
    1. You will need a license key in order to proceed.
3. Run `kubectl apply -f ./retool-secrets.yaml`
4. Run `kubectl apply -f ./retool-postgres.yaml`
4. Run `kubectl apply -f ./retool-container.yaml`

For ease of use, this will create a postgres container with a persistent volume for the storage of Retool data. We recommend that you use a managed database service like RDS as a long-term solution. The application will be exposed on a public ip address on port 3000 - we leave it to the user to handle DNS and SSL.

Please note that by default Retool is configured to use Secure Cookies - that means that you will be unable to login unless https has been correctly setup.

To force Retool to send the auth cookies over HTTP, please set the `COOKIE_INSECURE` environment variable to `'true'` in `./retool-container.yaml`. Do this by adding the following two lines to the `env` section.

```
        - name: COOKIE_INSECURE
          value: 'true'
```

Then, to update the running deployment, run `$ kubectl apply -f ./retool-container.yaml`

### Deploying on Kubernetes with Helm

See https://github.com/tryretool/retool-helm for full Helm chart documentation
and instructions.

## Additional features

**For details on additional features like SAML SSO, gRPC, custom certs, and more, visit our [docs](https://docs.retool.com/docs).**

### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables to enable custom functionality like [managing secrets](https://docs.retool.com/docs/secret-management-using-environment-variables), customizing logs, and much more. For a list of all environment variables visit our [docs](https://docs.retool.com/docs/environment-variables).

### Health check endpoint 

Retool also has a health check endpoint that you can set up to monitor liveliness of Retool. You can configure your probe to make a `GET` request to `/api/checkHealth`.

## Troubleshooting

- On Kubernetes, I get the error `SequelizeConnectionError: password authentication failed for user "..."`
    - Make sure that the secrets that you encoded in base64 don't have trailing whitespace! You can use `kubectl exec printenv` to help debug this issue.
    - Run `echo -n <license key> | base64` in the command line. The `-n` character removes the trailing newline character from the encoding.
- I can't seem to login? I keep getting redirected to the login page after signing in.
    - If you have not enabled SSL yet, you will need to add the line `COOKIE_INSECURE=true` to your `docker.env` file / environment configuration so that the authentication cookies can be sent over http. Make sure to run `sudo docker-compose up -d` after modifying the `docker.env` file.
- `TypeError: Cannot read property 'licenseVerification' of null` or `TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null`
    - There is an issue with your license key. Double check that the license key is correct and that it has no trailing whitespaces. 

## Updating Retool

The latest Retool releases can be pulled from Docker Hub. When you run an on-premise instance of Retool, you’ll need to pull an updated image in order to get new features and fixes. 

See more information on our different release channels and recommended update strategies in [our documentation](https://docs.retool.com/docs/updating-retool-on-premise#retool-release-versions).

### Docker Compose deployments
Update the version number in the first line of your `Dockerfile`.

```
FROM tryretool/backend:X.Y.Z
```
Then run the included update script `./update_retool.sh` from this directory.

### Kubernetes deployments
To update Retool on Kubernetes, you can use the following command, replacing `X.Y.Z` with the version number or named tag that you’d like to update to.

```
kubectl set image deploy/api api=tryretool/backend:X.Y.Z
```

### Heroku deployments
To update a Heroku deployment that was created with the button above, you may first set up a `git` repo to push to Heroku

```
$ heroku login
$ git clone https://github.com/tryretool/retool-onpremise
$ cd retool-onpremise
$ heroku git:remote -a YOUR_HEROKU_APP_NAME
```

To update Retool (this will automatically fetch the latest version of Retool)

```
$ git commit --allow-empty -m 'Redeploying'
$ git push heroku master
```
